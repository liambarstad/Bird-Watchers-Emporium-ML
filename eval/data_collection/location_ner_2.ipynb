In the south of its range, this tinamou is basically restricted to the littoral, whereas further north it also occurs over the interior. The species occurs from southern Piauí and eastern Pernambuco south to Rio Grande do Sul, but especially in the north of this range the Yellow-legged Tinamou is now generally scarce, and forest clearance has led to declines in its population virtually throughout eastern Brazil. Its song, which may be heard almost day-long during the breeding season (probably the austral spring, at least in the south of the range) is a slowly delivered and somewhat mournful two- or four-noted a-oo oo-a-oo or a-oo oo-oo, which to some extents recalls that of the partially sympatric Solitary Tinamou (Tinamus solitarius). The species is sometimes encountered in small groups, and some observers have suggested that the males might gather at leks, but this remains unconfirmed to date.'},\n",

Widespread and fairly common in at all tropical forest sites in Wetar, and more confiding there than on Timor (4); extensive forest remains on this small island.

In their assessment of the two taxa, del Hoyo and Collar (3), using the Tobias et al. (4) criteria, from which the numbers in brackets are derived, found that they differ in several plumage and morphometric characters. The comparison is based on one specimen of New Caledonian Buttonquail, a male with no specific locality and undated, but registered in the Natural History Museum in London in 1889: it differs from males of Painted Buttonquail in its smaller size (wing 80 mm versus 101.5 in one published sample (5), and bill 14.1 mm, tarsus 20 mm, and tail 39 mm) [allow 3]; dorsal and rump feathers mostly black versus black with rusty barring, without the rust color predominating on the mantle, and with proportionately more black markings in wing-coverts [2]; breast barred blackish-and-buff with some pale grey bases versus pale gray with buff blades with narrow blackish edges [2].'}]:\n",
