       "  'd.text': \"Forster's Tern is the only tern restricted almost entirely to North America throughout the year. Its highest breeding numbers are found around south-central Manitoba, northern California—southern Oregon, and the Gulf Coast. Its centers of abundance in early winter match those of its coastal breeding areas, particularly around the Virginia–North Carolina border, Galveston Bay (Texas), and near Jacksonville, Florida. Similar in appearance and ecology to several other terns, it is primarily a marsh bird, although it is also found along Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts.A “marsh tern,” this species breeds primarily in fresh, brackish, and saltwater marshes, including marshy borders of lakes, islands, or streams. It is found more often in open, deeper portions of marshes, generally in wetlands with considerable open water and large stands of island-like vegetation and/or large mats of floating vegetation. Along the Atlantic Coast, Forster's Tern breeds in marshy portions of beach and estuarine areas. The suitability of nesting habitat is often ephemeral, varying at a given site from year to year.Major studies on Forster's Tern have focused on its breeding ecology in Manitoba (McNicholl McNicholl 1971, McNicholl 1980c, McNicholl 1982, McNicholl 1983), feeding ecology in Minnesota (Fraser Fraser 1994a, Fraser 1997) and at San Francisco Bay, CA (Salt and Willard 1971), and vocalizations and behavior in Washington (Hall Hall 1988a, Hall 1989, Hall 1998c).\"},\n",

There is some documentation of birds taking spiders from webs (24). Birds have also been observed using their long tongue to probe dead tree-trunks for insect prey (24).Bird plucking insects from spider websBird using tongue to probe for insects on branchFruit Food SourcesCarica papaya has been noted as part of the diet of Streaked Spiderhunter (2). Two other \"natural\" frugivory observations of small fruit have been noted; one from a hybrid of the Buddleja globosa, and one feeding stations where fruit has been laid out at bird feeders (24). When feeding on the Buddleja globosa fruit, it was harvested with the tip of the bill, then worked back slowly until it could be swallowed. Birds have also been seen to eat the seeds of open cut papayas.Most of the lowland spiderhunter species have been observed feeding on a variety of fruit (25). Continued observations have shown that frugivory is a common activity among spiderhunters (Amar-Singh HSS, personal observation), and additional work may show frugivory is also more common in Streaked Spiderhunter.Bird feeding on fruit at a feeding station.Bird feeding on fruit.Bird feeding on fruit at a feeding station.Quantitative AnalysisNo thorough quantitative analyses have been published on the diet.'},\n",

Closely associated partners, individuals, or family groups forage mostly 0–1 m above ground, rarely to 3 m in treefalls or climbing vine tangles, usually apart from mixed-species flocks; mostly where semi-open but continuous, shrubby undergrowth is present within 2 m of ground. Moves deliberately from one vertical stem to another and on fallen suspended branches and logs by wing-assisted hops or short flights, or by hopping on ground between perches, with frequent pauses of a few seconds to scan for prey; pounds tail downwards, then slowly raises it. Clings laterally, with bottom leg extended and top leg flexed, to slender vertical stems, from which it drops or sallies to ground to seize prey, then jumps back up again, or reaches up, out or down to perch-glean prey from leaves, stems and branches with quick stabs of the bill; also makes short (less than 40 cm) sallies or shorter jump-gleans out or up to take prey from vegetation and branches; also clambers along low inclined or horizontal perches, particularly in fallen and broken bamboo stems and fallen tree branches; spends much time in hopping on ground beneath cover of overhanging broad-leaved vegetation. Regularly follows swarms of army ants (Eciton burchelli, Labidus praedator) for long periods (up to 253 minutes recorded), but usually remains mostly on periphery of swarms if these attended by “professional” ant-following species such as Rhegmatorhina, Phlegopsis or Gymnopithys; most prey captures over ants are by sallies from low perch to ground, or by hopping on ground and direct-gleaning or lunging; sometimes sallies upwards to foliage, stems or branches.

       "  'd.text': \"Editor's Note: Due to a recent taxonomic revision, this species account is still being edited and may contain content from an earlier version of the account.The Band-rumped Storm-Petrel ranges throughout the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It breeds away from continental areas on remote islands of Japan, the Hawaiian Archipelago, Galápagos, and small Eastern Atlantic islands off the coasts of Spain and Africa. Band-rumped Storm-Petrels, originating from Eastern Atlantic breeding populations and once thought only to be blown to the North American coast by storms, are now known to be regular visitors to within 50 kilometers of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. In the United States, this species breeds only in the Hawaiian Archipelago, where it is the rarest and smallest breeding seabird; exact locations for most colonies in the Hawaiian Archipelago are still unknown, though evidence suggests that some exist high on Hawaiian volcanoes (from about 2,400 to 3,350 m), making this one of the highest nesting seabird species in the world. The Band-rumped Storm-Petrel is not considered threatened worldwide, though it is a candidate for listing (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS] 1) because of its very small population size in the Hawaiian Archipelago.Band-rumped Storm-Petrels are members of the family Hydrobatidae (order Procellariiformes), characterized generally by small size and dark plumage (lighter underparts), nocturnal colony attendance, burrow-nesting behavior, and seizing of prey from the ocean surface. It is a member of the Northern Hemisphere subfamily Hydrobatinae, which is characterized by long, pointed wings; notched tails; and legs that do not project beyond the tail in flight. In contrast, the subfamily Oceanitinae is of Southern Hemisphere origin, and its species are characterized by short, rounded wings and legs usually extending beyond square tails.Storm-petrels, in general, are difficult to observe, and the Band-rumped Storm-Petrels are no exceptions. To avoid predation, populations breed on remote islands and often in inaccessible places, spending the nonbreeding season far out to sea. When breeding, they fly about over the ocean by day to feed on surface plankton and return to land only after dark, when they feed their young in cryptic nest burrows. Storm-petrels sighted at sea are usually hard to identify with certainty owing to often difficult viewing conditions, reluctance to follow ships, and the close similarities among species. Flight characteristics are often the key to distinguishing species.Owing to these difficulties, few researchers have studied Band-rumped Storm-Petrels in any detail. There are only 2 major breeding studies of Band-rumped Storm-Petrel: Allan (2; Ascension I.) and Harris (3; Galápagos Is.). Interestingly, more recent work on Band-rumped Storm-Petrel discovered that populations breeding at different seasons on one island in the Azores are distinct morphologically and genetically, generating allochronic speciation with the Monteiro's Storm-Petrel (Hydrobates monteiroi) (4).\"},\n",

Found at lower densities along forested rivers (10–20 km per pair in Gabon). Locally vulnerable to river degradation and hunting (e.g. in Ivory Coast), but also adaptable through flexible feeding habits and rapid exploitation of new impoundments or prey. Numbers at Lake Naivasha, Kenya, dropped from 165 birds in the late 1980s to about 70 in 1998, during which time successful breeding ceased due to declines in food availability from increased turbidity of lake water and loss of open water from floating mats of exotic plants (both caused by humans) (4). Successful breeding resumed in 1999 after heavy rains caused the lake level to rise 3 m and created new foraging habitat. Known to be contaminated with pesticides in some areas of Zimbabwe (8) and South Africa, but no obvious population effects.
