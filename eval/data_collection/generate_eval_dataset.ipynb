One name in particular, Conurus gundlachi (19, 20), was a particularly wide-spread synonym (21, 3). Under a variety of generic names, most authors have historically considered maugei as subspecifically related to P. holochlorus (e.g., 22, 1, 23, 24, 25, 10). Again, however, due largely to ambiguities surrounding the historical distribution and taxonomic validity of P. maugei, some works seemingly avoided mention of maugei, lumping it under P. chloropterus without comment (e.g., 26, 27). Still others (e.g., 28, 13, 29) returned maugei to full species status. Although far from complete, following guide to P. maugei synonyms (arranged alphabetically) will be a useful tool for navigating early literature that deals with the scant information available about the Puerto Rican Parakeet.Aratinga chloroptera maugaei (12)Aratinga chloroptera maugei (1, 30, 23, 31, 32, 2, 7, 6, 33, 5)Aratinga chloroptera (15, 27 [in part], 34)Aratinga maugei (13)Conurus chloropterus (35, 36, 14)Conurus euops Gundlachi (37)Conurus gundlachi (19, 19, 38, 39, 22)Conurus maugei (40, 21)Conurus maugei (?)

       "  'text': 'Minas Gerais Tyrannulets have 10 full-length primaries (numbered distally, from innermost p1 to outermost p10), 9 secondaries (numbered proximally, from innermost s1 to outermost s9 and including 3 tertials, s7–s9 in passerines), and 12 rectrices (numbered distally from innermost r1 to outermost r6 on each side of the tail). Little or no geographic variation in plumage has been reported (see Systematics); the following descriptions are based on those of Ridgely and Tudor (1) and Fitzpatrick et al. (2), along with examination of Macaulay Library images; see Pyle (3) for criteria used for age and sex determinations of similar tyrannid flycatchers. See Molts for molt and plumage terminology. Sexes are similar in all plumages; definitive appearance is assumed at the Second Basic Plumage. Timing of plumages relates to timing of molts, which appears to peak primarily in December-March following breeding primarily in October-January (see Breeding Phenology and Molts).Natal DownOccurs in the nest, perhaps primarily in November-December. No information on natal down in Minas Gerais Tyrannulet but in the congeneric Mottle-cheeked Tyrannulet (Phylloscartes ventralis) nestlings are covered with sparse gray natal down.Juvenile (First Basic) PlumageAppears to occur primarily in December-February. Similar to later plumages but body feathering is duller and paler. Crown and upperparts washed brown; underparts pale yellow with diffuse olive streaking. Upperwing median and greater coverts weaker and perhaps with buff or yellowish tips. Juvenile body feathering is more filamentous than that of later plumages due to lower barb densities. Juvenile flight feathers are narrower and more pointed than later generations and are fresh at a time of year when older birds are typically worn and/or molting.Juvenile Minas Gerais Tyrannulet.Juvenile Minas Gerais Tyrannulet.Juvenile Minas Gerais Tyrannulet.Formative PlumageAppears to occur primarily in March (when fresh) to February (when worn). Examination of Macaulay Library images indicates that the Preformative Molt is partial and that Formative Plumage is identified by molt limits among wing and sometimes tail feathers. Most to all upperwing secondary coverts and occasionally 1–2 inner tertials are replaced, and are fresher and blacker, contrasting with the more worn and browner, retained juvenile primary coverts and tertials or inner secondaries. Retained juvenile outer primaries and rectrices are narrow, tapered or pointed at the tips, abraded, and brownish; occasionally all rectrices may be replaced (see Molts) or perhaps more frequently, 1-2 pairs of inner rectrices are replaced and contrastingly gray and fresh.Formative Minas Gerais Tyrannulet.Formative Minas Gerais Tyrannulet.Formative Minas Gerais Tyrannulet.Definitive Basic PlumageAppears to occur primarily in March (when fresh) to February (when worn). Upperparts bright olive, the lores, sides of the forecrown and often the forehead washed rufous to ochraceous. Upperwing and tail feathers dusky, the median and greater coverts tipped pale yellow to whitish forming distinct wing bars, and the remaining remiges and rectrices distinctly edged white (tertials) to bright olive-yellow on the outer webs at the bases. Sides of head with indistinct yellowish super\\xadcilium, whitish eyering, and yellowish auriculars and malar region with a variably distinct to indistinct (or almost lacking) brownish crescent-shaped mark to the lores, suborbital area, and proximal auriculars. Underparts bright lemon yellow (when fresh) with diffuse olive streaking across breast and sides forming indistinct band or vested appearance. Underwing coverts appear to be pale lemon yellow (cf. ML463910311).Distinguished from Formative Plumage by having wing and tail feathers uniform in quality, lacking molt limits among upperwing coverts and tertials/inner secondaries. Primary coverts are black to blackish, forming a distinct black triangular patch not contrasting in quality of coloration with the bases of the greater coverts; caution that the greater alula is naturally browner in this species, creating a pseudolimit. Outer primaries and rectrices are broader, more truncate, duskier, and relatively fresher than retained juvenile feathers of Formative Plumage.Definitive Basic Minas Gerais Tyrannulet.Definitive Basic Minas Gerais Tyrannulet.Definitive Basic Minas Gerais Tyrannulet.'},\n",

W of line from Britain to Italy, also Balkans and C Turkey, populations sedentary or partial migrants, but Irish birds fully migratory and all other European breeders move S (passage in Spain from Sept, but mostly in Nov) and winter across N Africa in large numbers, with particularly strong representation near Algerian coast; many rubicola and variegatus occupy N Africa chiefly Oct–Mar. In Tunisia most breeders appear to disperse into desert in winter. Numbers of juveniles wintering in Spain falls over time while numbers of adults stay constant, suggesting that juveniles move farther S. Those wintering commonly in C & E Mediterranean presumably originate in SE Europe and Turkey, and populations in Ukraine and W Caucasus may also move to E Mediterranean and Middle East. Race variegatus migrates through E Transcaucasia Sept and Mar and via Iraq and Arabia, recorded Eritrea mid-Sept to end Mar; variegatus winters across Iraq and Arabia into NE Africa. In Israel, rubicola a very common passage migrant, with peaks in Nov and Mar; maurus, variegatus much rarer, but with essentially same dates; over winters with good rainfall numbers fairly constant, but with poor rainfall unpaired juveniles (high proportion of total) move out. In Jordan present mainly early Nov to mid-Mar. In UAE, rubicola fairly common winter visitor Nov to early Mar, with “maurus group” on irregular passage Sept and Apr, and similar pattern Bahrain. Scarce winter visitor in E Saudi Arabia late Aug to Feb (mainly from Oct), presumed maurus/stejnegeri, but passage of apparent variegatus in Mar. Race indicus extensively penetrates Indian Subcontinent, reaching extreme S areas of winter range Oct–Feb, moving N and upslope over Mar–Apr. Race przewalskii apparently resident in much of lowland range, including SW China, although possibly a partial migrant in some regions, and in high W of range on Tibetan Plateau fully migratory, departing mid-Oct to E Himalayan foothills and returning mid-Apr. Race stejnegeri leaves Russian breeding grounds second half Aug but Korean Peninsula not until early Oct (return there late Mar), with passage in Japan late Sept and Oct (return mid-Apr to early May), wintering N India and Myanmar E to S China; main autumn passage at Beidaihe (NE China) mid-Aug to mid-Oct, occupying coastal SE China, Taiwan and Hainan mostly mid-Oct to end Mar or early Apr; stragglers reach Singapore, N Borneo and Sumatra. Race maurus is a frequent vagrant to W Europe, while records of race stejnegeri has been proved also, by means of DNA analysis, at least in Sweden (Oct 2008), England (Oct 2012) and Finland (Nov 2013) (10).  In tropical Africa appears to be sedentary, or vertical migrant (some breeding at 1000–2000 m in Malawi descend to 450 m), or short-distance migrant; birds breeding in Lesotho descend lower in winter but some disperse as far as E Zimbabwe; those from E South Africa move into S Mozambique; and in Sierra Leone more pairs noted at 1370 m on Mt Bintimani in Apr than in Nov, suggesting upward spring movement.'},\n",

With the majority of its population restricted to only a few remote sites during much of the year, it was long regarded as one of the rarest birds on the continent, ranked with the likes of the Kirtland\\'s Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) and Bachman\\'s Warbler (Vermivora bachmanii) by the American Ornithologists\\' Union\\'s Committee on Bird Protection (1). Starting in the 1940s, however, biologists began to discover large migratory flocks at remote sites along the shores of James and Hudson Bays, leading to the realization that the status of the species was not as dire as it had seemed. More recently, additional fall staging sites have been found in Saskatchewan, along with major wintering areas in southern South America. The species is, nonetheless, highly vulnerable, with a population of between 50,000\\\\u201370,000 birds, the majority of which occur at only a handful of sites during the nonbreeding season.Although historically the biology of this godwit has been poorly known, that is beginning to change. Known breeding areas still account for only a small proportion of the estimated world population, however, and much of the breeding range clearly remains to be described. Those breeding areas that are known are disjunct, and studies by Susan Haig and colleagues suggest that different populations are as distinct genetically as those of any other bird species. This result is especially surprising given that no plumage or structural differences have been described. However, breeding habitat does vary greatly among sites, although it frequently consists of sedge meadows and muskeg at the tree line in Canada and Alaska, often near coastal mudflats or major river systems.The most detailed study of breeding biology was conducted by J. A. Hagar (2) at Churchill, Manitoba; this remains the benchmark description of the biology of the species. Additional work in that region, by J. R. Jehl, Jr., Joanna Klima, and colleagues, has also been pivotal in furthering our understanding of the species. In Alaska, Williamson and Smith (3) studied the Hudsonian Godwits in the vicinity of Cook Inlet, and a number of biologists elsewhere in the state have continued to find new breeding areas well into the 2000\\'s. Work begun at both Churchill and Cook Inlet will try to build on these seminal studies and to further our understanding of this species\\' breeding biology.After breeding, the Hudsonian Godwit undertakes a migration from the subarctic to southern South America, in which they make nonstop flights of several thousand miles. During the migration period, this species is found in various fresh-water and saline habitats. Its diet is not well known, but studies by Stuart Alexander and Cheri Gratto-Trevor have shown that migrating birds rely heavily on plant tubers at some inland staging sites (4, 5, 6); at other times, various invertebrates are taken.Nonbreeding Hudsonian Godwits concentrate at sites with large expanses of coastal mudflats. Increasingly, South American biologists are studying the biology of this species away from the breeding grounds. Detailed research at major nonbreeding sites has been initiated in Argentina and Chile and will be especially important for the future conservation of the species.\"}'}]}\n",

The center of breeding is along the coast of British Columbia.This small, abundant auklet nests in shallow burrows, which the birds excavate with their sharp toe nails, and also in rock crevices or under trees, cacti or logs. During the nonbreeding season, this species spends most of its time at sea, with southern populations likely moving north and northern ones moving south to the central portion of its eastern Pacific range; it is most abundant in waters overlying the continental shelf and slope where its preferred food includes small crustaceans, squid, and larval/juvenile fish. Where such prey are abundant, these birds often gather in large flocks, diving after prey propelled by their short, stubby wings. They gather their food and transport it back to the nest in a specialized throat pouch, a structure common to all true auklets.The timing of Cassin\\'s Auklet breeding varies with latitude and year. Birds nest in late fall through winter in Baja California, but in early to mid-summer in Alaska. Laying is late during El Ni\\\\u00f1o and like oceanographically anomalous years, and early when upwelling occurs early. This is the only alcid known to produce two consecutive broods in a single breeding season, at least in the southern part of the range where birds may be seen at nesting colonies year round. Vulnerable to aerial predators, especially large gulls and falcons, individuals fly between sea and colonies at night.Breeding biology is well known in this auklet, spanning the species\\' southern and central range, with major studies from the San Benito Is., Mexico; the Farallon Is., CA; and Triangle Is., BC, but little is known elsewhere (e.g. Manuwal 1974a, b, 1979; Vermeer 1987; Ainley et al.1990; Knechtel 1998; Hedd et al. 2002; Hipfner et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2007; Wolf 2007, Wolf et al. 2009, 2010). Key studies of auklets at sea include Abraham and Sydeman 2004, 2006; Adams et al. 2004a,b, 2010; Ainley et al. 1996, 2005, 2009; Ainley and Hyrenbach 2009; Boyd et al. 2008; Hyrenbach and Veit 2003; Lee et al. 2007.

(10). Under this nomenclature, terminology is based on evolution of molts along ancestral lineages of birds from ecdysis (molts) of reptiles, rather than on molts relative to breeding season, location, or time of the year, the latter generally referred to as \\\\u201clife-cycle\\\\u201d molt terminology (11; see also 12). As in other species formerly considered to be in Accipiter, Bicolored Hawk exhibits a Modified Basic Strategy (c.f. 10, 13), including incomplete-to-complete prebasic molts and a limited preformative molt in some to most individuals (8), but no prealternate molts (6).Prejuvenile (First Prebasic) MoltComplete, in the nest. No information on this molt in Bicolored Hawks. In other species formerly considered to be in Accipiter, sheaths begin to break about 11 d; rectrices, scapulars, and remiges protruding from down by day 21; between days 18\\\\u201321 contour feathers emerge along the ventral tract around the crop; juvenile feathering nearly complete by 28 d, although rectrices and remiges do not reach full length until 45\\\\u201354 d.Preformative MoltLimited. Includes some scattered to most body feathers over head, upperparts, and underparts but no flight feathers. Appears to occur in most or all Bicolored Hawks.Second Prebasic MoltIncomplete to complete; appears to be complete in the majority of Bicolored Hawks, especially those in northern portions of range. One to a few juvenile rump feathers and/or upperwing coverts can occasionally be retained; 1\\\\u20132 rectrices among r2 and r5 can rarely be retained; and 1\\\\u20136 juvenile secondaries (among s3\\\\u2013s4 and s7\\\\u2013s10) occasionally retained (see7, 6); in Bicolored Hawk retained feathers may be limited primarily to secondaries among s3-s4 and s7-s8, more frequently in southern portions of range.Definitive Prebasic MoltIncomplete-to-complete. Primaries replaced distally (p1 to p10), secondaries replaced proximally from s1 and s5 and distally from the tertials (often bilaterally from t2), and rectrices may be replaced in sequence r1\\\\u2013r3\\\\u2013r4\\\\u2013r6\\\\u2013r5\\\\u2013r2 on each side of tail, with some variation likely. Molt initiates with primaries, then secondaries, then secondary coverts and rectrices; rectrix, secondary, and most body-feather molt typically begins about 1 mo after onset of primary molt. In other species formerly considered to be in Accipiter, new body feathers appear first on head and foreparts, then elsewhere. One to a few basic rump feathers, upperwing coverts, outer primaries (among p8-p10), and rectrices (among r2 and r5) can rarely be retained; and 1\\\\u20136 basic secondaries (among s3\\\\u2013s4 and s7\\\\u2013s10) may be more frequently retained (7, 6). Following incomplete molts, Staffelmauser or stepwise molt can occur in some individuals, with retained basic feathers occurring in sets among the primaries and at various positions among the secondaries (see 14, 7, 15, 6).\"}'}]},\n",

Juvenile Plumage is retained until the first fall after hatch year.Prebasic MoltThe Prebasic Molt occurs in February–April.

      "A:  European Herring Gull: both adults make scrapes and perform Choking Display; Northern Red-billed Hornbill: male solely selects the nest site.\n",
      "G:  [{'bird_name': 'European Herring Gull', 'title': 'Nest Site', 'text': 'Selection ProcessThe male and female make several scrapes, up to 3–4 per territory, and add vegetation to make rudimentary nests. Both adults perform the Choking Display (see Behavior: Communicative Interactions) over specific scrapes; if they Choke together, that site is usually chosen. The ultimate decision is where the female lays eggs (102).Site CharacteristicsNests are built on the ground in treeless habitats, and locations that allow the sitting bird a clear view around it. The nest site is usually protected from prevailing wind(s), and is usually placed next to a large object (e.g., log, shrub, rock) which acts as a visual barrier between the nest and its closest neighbors (118, 109). Nests are usually less concealed than in sympatric-breeding Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus) (which it sometimes outcompetes and excludes; 92), relying on greater adult vigilance at the nest than on nest concealment (79). Depending on the substrate, nests can be located in rock crevices, in depressions scraped in sand or soft soil, or pressed down into short vegetation.

      "G:  [{'bird_name': 'Bay-ringed Tyrannulet', 'title': 'Plumages', 'text': 'The Bay-ringed Tyrannulets have 10 full-length primaries (numbered distally, from innermost p1 to outermost p10), 9 secondaries (numbered proximally, from innermost s1 to outermost s9 and including 3 tertials, s7–s9 in passerines), and 12 rectrices (numbered distally from innermost r1 to outermost r6 on each side of the tail). Little or no geographic variation in plumage has been reported (see Systematics); the following descriptions are based on those of Ridgely and Tudor (1) and Fitzpatrick et al. (2), along with examination of Macaulay Library images; see Pyle (3) for criteria used for age and sex determinations of similar tyrannid flycatchers. See Molts for molt and plumage terminology. Sexes are similar in all plumages; definitive appearance is assumed at the Second Basic Plumage. Timing of plumages relates to timing of molts, which appears to peak primarily in December-February following a reported extended breeding season in August-December (see Breeding Phenology and Molts).Natal DownOccurs in the nest, perhaps primarily in September-December. No information on natal down in Bay-ringed Tyrannulet but in the congeneric Mottle-cheeked Tyrannulet (Phylloscartes ventralis) nestlings are covered with sparse gray natal down.Juvenile (First Basic) PlumageMay occur primarily in October-February. Based on a Macaulay image (if correctly identified; see below) it appears to be similar to later plumages but body feathering is duller. Crown and upperparts washed gray; underparts pale gray to whitish washed dull yellow or olive and with diffuse olive streaking. The bay coloration around the eye appears to be absent. Juvenile body feathering is more filamentous than that of later plumages due to lower barb densities. Juvenile flight feathers are narrower and more pointed than later generations and are fresh at a time of year when older birds are typically worn and/or molting. Juveniles also appear to have a dark iris, perhaps lightening to amber (see Bare Parts).Formative PlumageAppears to occur primarily in February (when fresh) to December (when worn). Examination of Macaulay Library images indicates that the Preformative Molt is partial and that Formative Plumage is identified by molt limits among wing and perhaps occasionally tail feathers. Most to all upperwing lesser coverts, some to most inner median coverts, and no to a few inner greater coverts may be replaced and are fresher and greener, contrasting with the more worn and browner, retained juvenile outer secondary coverts, and primary coverts which show little or no olive edging. Look for 1-2 inner tertials (among s8-s9) and 1-2 central rectrices also to be replaced and contrastingly fresh. Retained juvenile outer primaries and rectrices are narrow, tapered or pointed at the tips, abraded, and brownish. Formative Plumage may also average duller than Definitive Basic Plumage, with a paler yellow chin and malar region and a less distinct bay eye patch. The iris also appears to transition from dark to white while in Formative Plumage (see Bare Parts).Formative Bay-ringed Tyrannulet. Formative Bay-ringed Tyrannulet. Definitive Basic PlumageAppears to occur primarily in March (when fresh) to December (when worn). Upperparts and crown bright olive; prominent loral patch and eyering rufous-chestnut; post ocular feathers and auriculars olive above, lacking much contrast with the dark eye patch, but bordered below by pale yellow lower auriculars and malar region. Upperwing coverts, remiges, and recrtices from above dusky edged olive, the greater coverts fringed pale yellow forming an indistinct wing bar. Chin yellow, sometimes fading to paler yellow on throat; rest of underparts whitish (when fresh) to white (when worn), often tinged greenish dusky on the sides of the breast (sometimes including a diffuse band that separates the throat) and the flanks, and/or with a very slight yellow tinge down the mid belly when fresh, and with pale yellow to yellow undertail coverts.Distinguished from Formative Plumage by having wing and tail feathers uniform in quality, lacking molt limits among upperwing coverts. Primary coverts are black to blackish, edged olive, and forming a distinct black triangular patch not contrasting in quality of coloration with the bases of the greater coverts (caution that the basic greater alula can sometimes be naturally slightly browner in this species, creating a pseudolimit). Outer primaries and rectrices are broader, more truncate, duskier, and relatively fresher than retained juvenile feathers of Formative Plumage.

Juvenile feathers contrastingly worn, narrow, and with narrower and more-distinct dark bars; replaced second basic rectrices can appear more juvenile-like than definitive rectrices.Third and Fourth Basic PlumagesThird Basic Plumage similar to Definitive Basic Plumage but can usually be identified by retained juvenile feathers in wing mixed with two generations of basic feathers (see Molts). 1-6 juvenile primaries (among p2–p4 and p9–p10) and 1–5 juvenile secondaries (among s3–s4 and s7–s10) may often be retained, these juvenile feathers contrastingly very worn, narrow, and with more-distinct dark bars. Occasionally all juvenile remiges replaced by Third Prebasic Molt in which case not separable from Definitive Basic Plumage. Individuals of larger owls may also be identified in Fourth Basic Plumage by retained juvenile feathers in wing, most typically among p3, p10, s4, and/or s9–s10, mixed with three generations of basic feathers. See images above.

Well-developed, outward-slanting ear tufts are composed of feathers of different sizes. Facial disc is whitish. Upperparts are dark brown, mottled and barred with buffy-white feather edges, and with partially whitish-buff outer edges to some lateral scapulars forming two indistinct pale streaks. Underparts are buffy-white, barred with blackish on throat and breast, with dark brown v-shaped spots on lower breast and abdomen. Tarsus is fully feathered. Sexes are similar (1).Some individual variation in plumage coloration and extent of markings occurs.Definitive Basic Plumage is distinguished from other plumages by lack of juvenile remiges, the feathers being a mixture of 2-4 generations of basic feathers (see Molts), wider and darker than juvenile feathers, generally with more diffuse dusky bars, and with less contrast between replaced and retained feathers (see 5, 6 for more information on ageing by molt patterns in large owls).Definitive Basic Spot-bellied Eagle-Owl (subspecies nipalensis).Definitive Basic Spot-bellied Eagle-Owl (subspecies nipalensis).Definitive Basic Spot-bellied Eagle-Owl (subspecies nipalensis).'}]\n",

Little or no geographic variation in plumage has been reported (see Systematics); the following descriptions are based on those of Ridgely and Tudor (1) and Fitzpatrick et al.

Sexes are similar in all plumages; definitive appearance is assumed at the Second Basic Plumage. Timing of plumages relates to timing of molts, which appears to peak primarily in December-February following a reported extended breeding season in August-December (see Breeding Phenology and Molts).Natal DownOccurs in the nest, perhaps primarily in September-December. No information on natal down in Bay-ringed Tyrannulet but in the congeneric Mottle-cheeked Tyrannulet (Phylloscartes ventralis) nestlings are covered with sparse gray natal down.Juvenile (First Basic) PlumageMay occur primarily in October-February. Based on a Macaulay image (if correctly identified; see below) it appears to be similar to later plumages but body feathering is duller. Crown and upperparts washed gray; underparts pale gray to whitish washed dull yellow or olive and with diffuse olive streaking. The bay coloration around the eye appears to be absent. Juvenile body feathering is more filamentous than that of later plumages due to lower barb densities. Juvenile flight feathers are narrower and more pointed than later generations and are fresh at a time of year when older birds are typically worn and/or molting. Juveniles also appear to have a dark iris, perhaps lightening to amber (see Bare Parts).Formative PlumageAppears to occur primarily in February (when fresh) to December (when worn). Examination of Macaulay Library images indicates that the Preformative Molt is partial and that Formative Plumage is identified by molt limits among wing and perhaps occasionally tail feathers. Most to all upperwing lesser coverts, some to most inner median coverts, and no to a few inner greater coverts may be replaced and are fresher and greener, contrasting with the more worn and browner, retained juvenile outer secondary coverts, and primary coverts which show little or no olive edging. Look for 1-2 inner tertials (among s8-s9) and 1-2 central rectrices also to be replaced and contrastingly fresh. Retained juvenile outer primaries and rectrices are narrow, tapered or pointed at the tips, abraded, and brownish. Formative Plumage may also average duller than Definitive Basic Plumage, with a paler yellow chin and malar region and a less distinct bay eye patch. The iris also appears to transition from dark to white while in Formative Plumage (see Bare Parts).Formative Bay-ringed Tyrannulet. Formative Bay-ringed Tyrannulet. Definitive Basic PlumageAppears to occur primarily in March (when fresh) to December (when worn). Upperparts and crown bright olive; prominent loral patch and eyering rufous-chestnut; post ocular feathers and auriculars olive above, lacking much contrast with the dark eye patch, but bordered below by pale yellow lower auriculars and malar region. Upperwing coverts, remiges, and recrtices from above dusky edged olive, the greater coverts fringed pale yellow forming an indistinct wing bar. Chin yellow, sometimes fading to paler yellow on throat; rest of underparts whitish (when fresh) to white (when worn), often tinged greenish dusky on the sides of the breast (sometimes including a diffuse band that separates the throat) and the flanks, and/or with a very slight yellow tinge down the mid belly when fresh, and with pale yellow to yellow undertail coverts.Distinguished from Formative Plumage by having wing and tail feathers uniform in quality, lacking molt limits among upperwing coverts. Primary coverts are black to blackish, edged olive, and forming a distinct black triangular patch not contrasting in quality of coloration with the bases of the greater coverts (caution that the basic greater alula can sometimes be naturally slightly browner in this species, creating a pseudolimit).

No information on natal down in Bay-ringed Tyrannulet but in the congeneric Mottle-cheeked Tyrannulet (Phylloscartes ventralis) nestlings are covered with sparse gray natal down.Juvenile (First Basic) PlumageMay occur primarily in October-February. Based on a Macaulay image (if correctly identified; see below) it appears to be similar to later plumages but body feathering is duller. Crown and upperparts washed gray; underparts pale gray to whitish washed dull yellow or olive and with diffuse olive streaking. The bay coloration around the eye appears to be absent. Juvenile body feathering is more filamentous than that of later plumages due to lower barb densities. Juvenile flight feathers are narrower and more pointed than later generations and are fresh at a time of year when older birds are typically worn and/or molting. Juveniles also appear to have a dark iris, perhaps lightening to amber (see Bare Parts).Formative PlumageAppears to occur primarily in February (when fresh) to December (when worn). Examination of Macaulay Library images indicates that the Preformative Molt is partial and that Formative Plumage is identified by molt limits among wing and perhaps occasionally tail feathers. Most to all upperwing lesser coverts, some to most inner median coverts, and no to a few inner greater coverts may be replaced and are fresher and greener, contrasting with the more worn and browner, retained juvenile outer secondary coverts, and primary coverts which show little or no olive edging. Look for 1-2 inner tertials (among s8-s9) and 1-2 central rectrices also to be replaced and contrastingly fresh. Retained juvenile outer primaries and rectrices are narrow, tapered or pointed at the tips, abraded, and brownish. Formative Plumage may also average duller than Definitive Basic Plumage, with a paler yellow chin and malar region and a less distinct bay eye patch. The iris also appears to transition from dark to white while in Formative Plumage (see Bare Parts).Formative Bay-ringed Tyrannulet. Formative Bay-ringed Tyrannulet. Definitive Basic PlumageAppears to occur primarily in March (when fresh) to December (when worn). Upperparts and crown bright olive; prominent loral patch and eyering rufous-chestnut; post ocular feathers and auriculars olive above, lacking much contrast with the dark eye patch, but bordered below by pale yellow lower auriculars and malar region. Upperwing coverts, remiges, and recrtices from above dusky edged olive, the greater coverts fringed pale yellow forming an indistinct wing bar. Chin yellow, sometimes fading to paler yellow on throat; rest of underparts whitish (when fresh) to white (when worn), often tinged greenish dusky on the sides of the breast (sometimes including a diffuse band that separates the throat) and the flanks, and/or with a very slight yellow tinge down the mid belly when fresh, and with pale yellow to yellow undertail coverts.Distinguished from Formative Plumage by having wing and tail feathers uniform in quality, lacking molt limits among upperwing coverts. Primary coverts are black to blackish, edged olive, and forming a distinct black triangular patch not contrasting in quality of coloration with the bases of the greater coverts (caution that the basic greater alula can sometimes be naturally slightly browner in this species, creating a pseudolimit).

Elsewhere, colonies on 17 Australian islands all small (< 1000 pairs) and totalling just 1300–3500 pairs (41), with c. 10,000–20,000 pairs in the Falklands (42), but many more in S Chile, where some colonies are estimated to number up to 200,000 pairs (4) and recently confirmed to breed on Tristan da Cunha, with breeding also suspected on Inaccessible I (6).

The latter authors designated this specimen as the lectotype of Neumann’s name, but their designation was clearly unnecessary. Although Neumann (8) stated, incorrectly, that the specimen concerned was collected in January, rather than in June, in all other respects, including the fact that it had been in Boardman Conover’s private collection, its details are clearly concordant with the type designated in the original description. Evangelista-Vargas et al. (2) claimed that Neumann (8) did not designate a “holotype”, but he clearly selected a single name-bearing “type” (Art. 72.4.6; 9) and noted the availability of six other specimens (of which no details were provided; the whereabouts of these paratypes is unknown).Synonym:Penelope superciliares [sic] cyanosparius Nardelli, 1993, The Preservation of the Alagoas Curassow Mitu mitu, Brazil, p. 9.—headwaters of the Maués River, Amazonas, Brazil (3).

Compared to nominate P. s. superciliaris, he considered pseudonyma to be overall darker, and to have the well-marked edges to the secondaries, rump, and uppertail-coverts dark maroon (8). However, as noted by Evangelista-Vargas et al. (2), Neumann overlooked the key criterion that differentiates pseudonyma from the others, despite that it was noted by the collector, namely the dark blue naked facial skin. It was also clearly highlighted by Nardelli (3) in his description of the synonym cyanosparius.EBIRD GROUP (POLYTYPIC)Rusty-margined Guan (Gray-faced)Penelope superciliaris [superciliaris Group]eBird map3  s0 recordingsSUBSPECIESPenelope superciliaris superciliarisScientific name definitionsP. s. superciliarisSystematics HistoryPenelope superciliaris Temminck, 1815, Histoire naturelle générale des Pigeons et des Gallinacés, Volume 3, pp. 72, 693.—state of Pará, Brazil.Temminck based this new species on a specimen in his own collection and three specimens (two adults and a young bird) in what is now the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, all sent by Johann Centurius Hoffmann Graf von Hoffmannsegg (1766–1849), with the bird from Pará, Brazil sent to Temminck presumably stemming from Friedrich Wilhelm Sieber (b. 1789) (see 11, 12), but this specimen is no longer in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden (RMNH) (10, 13, 14). Hellmayr and Conover (10) suggested that only the specimen originally in Leiden had type status, but this view has no validity under the modern Code (9), as Temminck did not indicate a single “type”, thus all (four) of the specimens mentioned in the original description must be considered part of the type series (i.e., syntypes). Hellmayr’s indication that the “type” was the lost specimen in Leiden cannot be deemed a lectotype designation, because not only did Hellmayr lack any intent to so designate this specimen, but he was also expressly excluding the Berlin specimens (from Bahia via the naturalist Francisco Agostinho Gomes, 1769‒1842) from ever possessing type status. Nevertheless, this does mean that the original type series must be considered mixed, with the only extant material pertaining to what we now consider to be Penelope superciliaris jacupemba Spix.DistributionNorth-central and eastern Brazil south of the Amazon (south to Maranhão).Field IdentificationNominate superciliaris differs from P. s. jacupemba by being darker, less grayish, above, by having darker rufous edges on the wing-coverts, scapulars, and inner secondaries, and by having a somewhat less well-defined superciliary streak which varies from grayish white to buffy white, whereas it varies from grayish or buffy white to ochraceous in jacupemba (7).SUBSPECIESPenelope superciliaris jacupembaScientific name definitionsSystematics HistoryPenelope jacupemba Spix, 1825, Avium species novae, quas in itinere annis MDCCCXVII-MDCCCXX per Brasiliam, Tomus 2, p. 55, Plate 72.—Presidio do São João, Rio de Janeiro.As noted by Hellmayr (15, 10) the original description was evidently based on two individuals—one with a grayer superciliary, the other more rufous—but only one of these specimens collected by Johann Baptist Ritter von Spix (1781–1826) is still held in the Zoologischen Staatssammlung München (ZSM); the lost specimen is apparently the gray-browed bird illustrated in the plate (15, 10, 16).

Lako on 12 June 1929 (not January as stated in the original description), is held in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago (FMNH 407458) (2). The latter authors designated this specimen as the lectotype of Neumann’s name, but their designation was clearly unnecessary. Although Neumann (8) stated, incorrectly, that the specimen concerned was collected in January, rather than in June, in all other respects, including the fact that it had been in Boardman Conover’s private collection, its details are clearly concordant with the type designated in the original description. Evangelista-Vargas et al. (2) claimed that Neumann (8) did not designate a “holotype”, but he clearly selected a single name-bearing “type” (Art. 72.4.6; 9) and noted the availability of six other specimens (of which no details were provided; the whereabouts of these paratypes is unknown).Synonym:Penelope superciliares [sic] cyanosparius Nardelli, 1993, The Preservation of the Alagoas Curassow Mitu mitu, Brazil, p. 9.—headwaters of the Maués River, Amazonas, Brazil (3). Original description not seen. This taxon was erected on the basis of live specimens held in captivity, without any specimen deposited in a scientific collection, but supported by color plates. Evangelista-Vargas et al. (2) clearly established that both Neumann (8) and Nardelli (3) had described blue-faced birds, and therefore that the former’s name had priority for this population.P. s. pseudonyma was erroneously treated in the synonymy of P. s. superciliaris by Hellmayr and Conover (10) and Vaurie (6, 7), who also overlooked its key differentiating character (see below).DistributionEndemic to the Madeira-Tapajós interfluvium of central Amazonian Brazil (2).Field IdentificationIn the original description, Neumann (8) postulated that the feature distinguishing his new taxon from all others in Penelope superciliaris was the complete lack of a superciliary stripe, or at most only a poorly indicated thin grayish-white line behind the eye is present. Compared to nominate P. s. superciliaris, he considered pseudonyma to be overall darker, and to have the well-marked edges to the secondaries, rump, and uppertail-coverts dark maroon (8). However, as noted by Evangelista-Vargas et al. (2), Neumann overlooked the key criterion that differentiates pseudonyma from the others, despite that it was noted by the collector, namely the dark blue naked facial skin. It was also clearly highlighted by Nardelli (3) in his description of the synonym cyanosparius.EBIRD GROUP (POLYTYPIC)Rusty-margined Guan (Gray-faced)Penelope superciliaris [superciliaris Group]eBird map3  s0 recordingsSUBSPECIESPenelope superciliaris superciliarisScientific name definitionsP. s. superciliarisSystematics HistoryPenelope superciliaris Temminck, 1815, Histoire naturelle générale des Pigeons et des Gallinacés, Volume 3, pp. 72, 693.—state of Pará, Brazil.Temminck based this new species on a specimen in his own collection and three specimens (two adults and a young bird) in what is now the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, all sent by Johann Centurius Hoffmann Graf von Hoffmannsegg (1766–1849), with the bird from Pará, Brazil sent to Temminck presumably stemming from Friedrich Wilhelm Sieber (b. 1789) (see 11, 12), but this specimen is no longer in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden (RMNH) (10, 13, 14). Hellmayr and Conover (10) suggested that only the specimen originally in Leiden had type status, but this view has no validity under the modern Code (9), as Temminck did not indicate a single “type”, thus all (four) of the specimens mentioned in the original description must be considered part of the type series (i.e., syntypes). Hellmayr’s indication that the “type” was the lost specimen in Leiden cannot be deemed a lectotype designation, because not only did Hellmayr lack any intent to so designate this specimen, but he was also expressly excluding the Berlin specimens (from Bahia via the naturalist Francisco Agostinho Gomes, 1769‒1842) from ever possessing type status. Nevertheless, this does mean that the original type series must be considered mixed, with the only extant material pertaining to what we now consider to be Penelope superciliaris jacupemba Spix.DistributionNorth-central and eastern Brazil south of the Amazon (south to Maranhão).Field IdentificationNominate superciliaris differs from P. s. jacupemba by being darker, less grayish, above, by having darker rufous edges on the wing-coverts, scapulars, and inner secondaries, and by having a somewhat less well-defined superciliary streak which varies from grayish white to buffy white, whereas it varies from grayish or buffy white to ochraceous in jacupemba (7).SUBSPECIESPenelope superciliaris jacupembaScientific name definitionsSystematics HistoryPenelope jacupemba Spix, 1825, Avium species novae, quas in itinere annis MDCCCXVII-MDCCCXX per Brasiliam, Tomus 2, p. 55, Plate 72.—Presidio do São João, Rio de Janeiro.As noted by Hellmayr (15, 10) the original description was evidently based on two individuals—one with a grayer superciliary, the other more rufous—but only one of these specimens collected by Johann Baptist Ritter von Spix (1781–1826) is still held in the Zoologischen Staatssammlung München (ZSM); the lost specimen is apparently the gray-browed bird illustrated in the plate (15, 10, 16). Hellmayr (15, 10) speculated that the locality indicated by Spix might be incorrect and that at least one of the specimen might instead have originated from northeast Brazil (which Spix also visited).Synonyms:Penelope superciliaris argyromitra Neumann, 1933, Bulletin of the British Ornithologists’ Club 33:94.—Veadeiros, northwest of Forte, central Goiás (8).

It shows some variation in quality and length of the first few notes, though the structure of the phrase remains the same, with the final note falling dramatically and having the greatest frequency range. This vocalization appears to serve primarily as the territorial song of the species, and it is often considered to be the Primary Song of the species. It is usually repeated at intervals of 2–5 seconds for long periods of up to 3 minutes throughout the day, especially early in the breeding season.Courtship Song.audioA series of complex, warbling, musical phrases of rising and falling elements consisting of 3–12 unique notes, with a large frequency range between 2–9 kHz, and variable duration of 0.3–1.6 seconds per phrase (most phrases around 1 second long), with song bouts lasting for a duration of 1.5–4 minutes. There are no repetitions of the song-phrases, with each phrase unique and showing great variability in quality and construction. During one observation it was given by the presumed male of an apparently mated or courting pair from a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree, while another individual quietly fed close by on the flowers of the same tree. It is only known from two recordings in early May, at different times of day, possibly from the same presumed male. This vocalization, not previously described, differs from the Primary Song in its much greater variety of phrases. It apparently functions as a courtship song, probably given just before nesting commences.Swee or Suweet.audio2 The primary call is a thin, penetrating, up-slurred whistle at around 4–7 kHz, lasting about 0.3 seconds, and repeated every few seconds. It is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics and intruders from territory or suitable foraging areas. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation has been heard from a presumed femaleaudiowhen an intruding Long-tailed Shrike (Lanius schach) was near her nest-site. Both parents would give this call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance.Pip. A short pip contact-call sometimes used by adults to keep in touch with recently fledged juveniles.Geographic VariationNone documented.PhenologyPrimary Song is given from summer onwards and through the breeding season up to at least late July; has also been heard by birds on spring passage in March outside the breeding range in the western Himalayan foothills (8), and one recording also from Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra in the Western Ghats in the same month. There are no known recordings of the Primary Song from outside the breeding season in either autumn or winter and it is probably seldom heard once the young have fledged. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given throughout the year, being the only call typically heard during the nonbreeding season or in its wintering range. The courtship song is given early in the breeding season, probably given just before nesting commences apparently during the pair formation period, probably from late April and upto early May at least, on the breeding grounds.Daily Pattern of VocalizingOnly anecdotal information available. In the breeding season, the Primary Song is given repeatedly and relentlessly throughout the day especially at the beginning of the breeding season when nest-building activities are taking place by the female. The males are aggressively territorial, usually vocalizing throughout the nest-building period, taking short breaks to feed but continuing to vocalize even during foraging; repeatedly give the Primary Song from fixed perches, especially on or near the branch on which the nest was placed. In the nonbreeding season, the birds would give their primary call Swee or Suweet in well-spaced intervals while foraging, more consistently in the early mornings and usually when foraging; but would give this call arbitrarily throughout the day. Begging calls by the juveniles were given constantly through the day, more insistently when the parents were foraging nearby.Places of VocalizingThe Primary Song is given from a variety of perches, including from high in conifer trees, on prominent vantage points, and while foraging low in shrubs or undergrowth near the ground. The few observations of Courtship Song are of birds perched on a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given from a variety of perches, including while foraging low or in upper canopy.

The Primary Song is apparently given only by males, as it was not heard from the nest-building individual (presumed female) during observations from Himachal Pradesh, India (8). The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site; unknown if this variation is a true gender difference or if males can also give this call.Repertoire and Delivery of SongsLittle information available. See Primary Song, above. Based on observations from Himachal Pradesh, as well as from Bangus Meadows, Kashmir, more than two and up to six males can be heard giving the primary song from within a distance of 80–200 meters in suitable habitat, and at times, while foraging together in the same plant or tree (8).Social Context and Presumed Functions of VocalizationsMore study needed. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics from territory or suitable foraging areas. It is also given by presumed males to drive away heterospecifics from territory in the breeding season such as a Yellow-bellied Fairy-Fantail (Chelidorhynx hypoxanthus) that was foraging in the same tree from where the presumed male was delivering its courtship song. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation of the primary call was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site. Both parents would give the primary call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance. The Primary Song appears to primarily function as the territorial song of the species. The courtship song is probably given just before nesting commences, apparently given during the pair formation period.Historical NotesHistorically, there are very few descriptions of the vocalizations of the species and some accounts given of its calls and song are puzzling or difficult to interpret. Most descriptions are generalized and do not afford clarity with one or two exceptions. The first mention of the vocalizations of the species was by Brooks (10: 23) from Kashmir, “In notes and song (if the few notes it utters can be called a song) P. tytleri is utterly different from P. viridanus [= Greenish Warbler Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus]. Its call-note is very peculiar, and once heard could not easily be forgotten.” He also goes on to say, “Properly speaking, none of the notes of P. Tytleri could be called a song, but the song of P. viridanus is not at all a bad one, and quite Phylloscopine.” (11: 80). The Primary Song of the species has been rather aptly paraphrased by Osmaston (12: 990) from observations in Gulmarg, Kashmir as, “the note or song of this species, if it can be called a song, resembles the words ‘Let's kiss him’ repeated at frequent intervals.” Paludan (13) noted the song as ‘’tji-jeep, ‘’tji-jeep’ and ‘vitjip-vitjip’ from its breeding grounds in Nuristan, Afghanistan. Roberts (14) described the song as high pitched, not very loud, and distinctly sibilant rising and falling phrase of about four syllables, the first two short and the last two more emphasized and drawn-out, showing considerable variation but always recognizable of the species. While Jones (15) described the call-note as a thin squeak, it was more accurately described as ‘a plaintive sooeet’ by Price and Jamdar (7); but described as more generalized statements such as, ‘a single squeaky note’ (16) or that the ‘call-note is feeble’ (17). It was also described as a slightly disyllabic call-note which was transcribed as tsee-it (5) and was also likened to Oriental Magpie-Robin (Copsychus saularis)-like ‘sweeee’ in tone, quality and loudness (1).\"}, {'bird_name': 'Short-billed Honeycreeper', 'title': 'Vocalizations', 'text': 'The Short-billed Honeycreeper has a small, indistinct voice.

Phrase has a 3-part structure, typically starting with 4 subdued coos sounding like two inhale/exhale introductory notes, followed by 2‒5 loud emphasized coos after which an auditive change initiates a series of 5‒8 quickly delivered coos, slightly descending in pitch and fading towards the end: whu-huu..whu-huu..whOO-whOO-whOO-whOO-who-hu-hu-hu-hu-hu.

Roberts (14) described the song as high pitched, not very loud, and distinctly sibilant rising and falling phrase of about four syllables, the first two short and the last two more emphasized and drawn-out, showing considerable variation but always recognizable of the species. While Jones (15) described the call-note as a thin squeak, it was more accurately described as ‘a plaintive sooeet’ by Price and Jamdar (7); but described as more generalized statements such as, ‘a single squeaky note’ (16) or that the ‘call-note is feeble’ (17).

It shows some variation in quality and length of the first few notes, though the structure of the phrase remains the same, with the final note falling dramatically and having the greatest frequency range. This vocalization appears to serve primarily as the territorial song of the species, and it is often considered to be the Primary Song of the species. It is usually repeated at intervals of 2–5 seconds for long periods of up to 3 minutes throughout the day, especially early in the breeding season.Courtship Song.audioA series of complex, warbling, musical phrases of rising and falling elements consisting of 3–12 unique notes, with a large frequency range between 2–9 kHz, and variable duration of 0.3–1.6 seconds per phrase (most phrases around 1 second long), with song bouts lasting for a duration of 1.5–4 minutes. There are no repetitions of the song-phrases, with each phrase unique and showing great variability in quality and construction. During one observation it was given by the presumed male of an apparently mated or courting pair from a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree, while another individual quietly fed close by on the flowers of the same tree. It is only known from two recordings in early May, at different times of day, possibly from the same presumed male. This vocalization, not previously described, differs from the Primary Song in its much greater variety of phrases. It apparently functions as a courtship song, probably given just before nesting commences.Swee or Suweet.audio2 The primary call is a thin, penetrating, up-slurred whistle at around 4–7 kHz, lasting about 0.3 seconds, and repeated every few seconds. It is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics and intruders from territory or suitable foraging areas. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation has been heard from a presumed femaleaudiowhen an intruding Long-tailed Shrike (Lanius schach) was near her nest-site. Both parents would give this call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance.Pip. A short pip contact-call sometimes used by adults to keep in touch with recently fledged juveniles.Geographic VariationNone documented.PhenologyPrimary Song is given from summer onwards and through the breeding season up to at least late July; has also been heard by birds on spring passage in March outside the breeding range in the western Himalayan foothills (8), and one recording also from Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra in the Western Ghats in the same month. There are no known recordings of the Primary Song from outside the breeding season in either autumn or winter and it is probably seldom heard once the young have fledged. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given throughout the year, being the only call typically heard during the nonbreeding season or in its wintering range. The courtship song is given early in the breeding season, probably given just before nesting commences apparently during the pair formation period, probably from late April and upto early May at least, on the breeding grounds.Daily Pattern of VocalizingOnly anecdotal information available. In the breeding season, the Primary Song is given repeatedly and relentlessly throughout the day especially at the beginning of the breeding season when nest-building activities are taking place by the female. The males are aggressively territorial, usually vocalizing throughout the nest-building period, taking short breaks to feed but continuing to vocalize even during foraging; repeatedly give the Primary Song from fixed perches, especially on or near the branch on which the nest was placed. In the nonbreeding season, the birds would give their primary call Swee or Suweet in well-spaced intervals while foraging, more consistently in the early mornings and usually when foraging; but would give this call arbitrarily throughout the day. Begging calls by the juveniles were given constantly through the day, more insistently when the parents were foraging nearby.Places of VocalizingThe Primary Song is given from a variety of perches, including from high in conifer trees, on prominent vantage points, and while foraging low in shrubs or undergrowth near the ground. The few observations of Courtship Song are of birds perched on a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given from a variety of perches, including while foraging low or in upper canopy.

The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site; unknown if this variation is a true gender difference or if males can also give this call.Repertoire and Delivery of SongsLittle information available. See Primary Song, above. Based on observations from Himachal Pradesh, as well as from Bangus Meadows, Kashmir, more than two and up to six males can be heard giving the primary song from within a distance of 80–200 meters in suitable habitat, and at times, while foraging together in the same plant or tree (8).Social Context and Presumed Functions of VocalizationsMore study needed. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics from territory or suitable foraging areas. It is also given by presumed males to drive away heterospecifics from territory in the breeding season such as a Yellow-bellied Fairy-Fantail (Chelidorhynx hypoxanthus) that was foraging in the same tree from where the presumed male was delivering its courtship song. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation of the primary call was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site. Both parents would give the primary call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance. The Primary Song appears to primarily function as the territorial song of the species.

Most descriptions are generalized and do not afford clarity with one or two exceptions. The first mention of the vocalizations of the species was by Brooks (10: 23) from Kashmir, “In notes and song (if the few notes it utters can be called a song) P. tytleri is utterly different from P. viridanus [= Greenish Warbler Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus].

It shows some variation in quality and length of the first few notes, though the structure of the phrase remains the same, with the final note falling dramatically and having the greatest frequency range. This vocalization appears to serve primarily as the territorial song of the species, and it is often considered to be the Primary Song of the species. It is usually repeated at intervals of 2–5 seconds for long periods of up to 3 minutes throughout the day, especially early in the breeding season.Courtship Song.audioA series of complex, warbling, musical phrases of rising and falling elements consisting of 3–12 unique notes, with a large frequency range between 2–9 kHz, and variable duration of 0.3–1.6 seconds per phrase (most phrases around 1 second long), with song bouts lasting for a duration of 1.5–4 minutes. There are no repetitions of the song-phrases, with each phrase unique and showing great variability in quality and construction. During one observation it was given by the presumed male of an apparently mated or courting pair from a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree, while another individual quietly fed close by on the flowers of the same tree. It is only known from two recordings in early May, at different times of day, possibly from the same presumed male. This vocalization, not previously described, differs from the Primary Song in its much greater variety of phrases. It apparently functions as a courtship song, probably given just before nesting commences.Swee or Suweet.audio2 The primary call is a thin, penetrating, up-slurred whistle at around 4–7 kHz, lasting about 0.3 seconds, and repeated every few seconds. It is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics and intruders from territory or suitable foraging areas. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation has been heard from a presumed femaleaudiowhen an intruding Long-tailed Shrike (Lanius schach) was near her nest-site. Both parents would give this call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance.Pip. A short pip contact-call sometimes used by adults to keep in touch with recently fledged juveniles.Geographic VariationNone documented.PhenologyPrimary Song is given from summer onwards and through the breeding season up to at least late July; has also been heard by birds on spring passage in March outside the breeding range in the western Himalayan foothills (8), and one recording also from Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra in the Western Ghats in the same month. There are no known recordings of the Primary Song from outside the breeding season in either autumn or winter and it is probably seldom heard once the young have fledged. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given throughout the year, being the only call typically heard during the nonbreeding season or in its wintering range. The courtship song is given early in the breeding season, probably given just before nesting commences apparently during the pair formation period, probably from late April and upto early May at least, on the breeding grounds.Daily Pattern of VocalizingOnly anecdotal information available. In the breeding season, the Primary Song is given repeatedly and relentlessly throughout the day especially at the beginning of the breeding season when nest-building activities are taking place by the female. The males are aggressively territorial, usually vocalizing throughout the nest-building period, taking short breaks to feed but continuing to vocalize even during foraging; repeatedly give the Primary Song from fixed perches, especially on or near the branch on which the nest was placed. In the nonbreeding season, the birds would give their primary call Swee or Suweet in well-spaced intervals while foraging, more consistently in the early mornings and usually when foraging; but would give this call arbitrarily throughout the day. Begging calls by the juveniles were given constantly through the day, more insistently when the parents were foraging nearby.Places of VocalizingThe Primary Song is given from a variety of perches, including from high in conifer trees, on prominent vantage points, and while foraging low in shrubs or undergrowth near the ground. The few observations of Courtship Song are of birds perched on a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given from a variety of perches, including while foraging low or in upper canopy. Begging calls by juveniles were given from low (2–3 meters), inconspicuous perches, usually near the ground, where the juveniles were well obscured.seekmute0:00 / 0:25Primary Song© Puja SharmaKinnaur, Himachal Pradesh, India 29 May 2017Macaulay Library ML 370988931eBirdS67121476Sex DifferencesLittle information. The Primary Song is apparently given only by males, as it was not heard from the nest-building individual (presumed female) during observations from Himachal Pradesh, India (8). The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site; unknown if this variation is a true gender difference or if males can also give this call.Repertoire and Delivery of SongsLittle information available. See Primary Song, above. Based on observations from Himachal Pradesh, as well as from Bangus Meadows, Kashmir, more than two and up to six males can be heard giving the primary song from within a distance of 80–200 meters in suitable habitat, and at times, while foraging together in the same plant or tree (8).Social Context and Presumed Functions of VocalizationsMore study needed. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics from territory or suitable foraging areas. It is also given by presumed males to drive away heterospecifics from territory in the breeding season such as a Yellow-bellied Fairy-Fantail (Chelidorhynx hypoxanthus) that was foraging in the same tree from where the presumed male was delivering its courtship song. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation of the primary call was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site. Both parents would give the primary call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance. The Primary Song appears to primarily function as the territorial song of the species. The courtship song is probably given just before nesting commences, apparently given during the pair formation period.Historical NotesHistorically, there are very few descriptions of the vocalizations of the species and some accounts given of its calls and song are puzzling or difficult to interpret. Most descriptions are generalized and do not afford clarity with one or two exceptions. The first mention of the vocalizations of the species was by Brooks (10: 23) from Kashmir, “In notes and song (if the few notes it utters can be called a song) P. tytleri is utterly different from P. viridanus [= Greenish Warbler Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus]. Its call-note is very peculiar, and once heard could not easily be forgotten.” He also goes on to say, “Properly speaking, none of the notes of P. Tytleri could be called a song, but the song of P. viridanus is not at all a bad one, and quite Phylloscopine.” (11: 80). The Primary Song of the species has been rather aptly paraphrased by Osmaston (12: 990) from observations in Gulmarg, Kashmir as, “the note or song of this species, if it can be called a song, resembles the words ‘Let's kiss him’ repeated at frequent intervals.” Paludan (13) noted the song as ‘’tji-jeep, ‘’tji-jeep’ and ‘vitjip-vitjip’ from its breeding grounds in Nuristan, Afghanistan. Roberts (14) described the song as high pitched, not very loud, and distinctly sibilant rising and falling phrase of about four syllables, the first two short and the last two more emphasized and drawn-out, showing considerable variation but always recognizable of the species.

Can be given constantly through the day, more insistently when the parents were foraging nearby, at the rate of one note per second for long durations of up to 2 minutes, until the begging juvenile was fed. The rate of calling can accelerate to as fast as two notes per second for 4–6 seconds when the parent approaches to feed the juveniles.

It shows some variation in quality and length of the first few notes, though the structure of the phrase remains the same, with the final note falling dramatically and having the greatest frequency range. This vocalization appears to serve primarily as the territorial song of the species, and it is often considered to be the Primary Song of the species. It is usually repeated at intervals of 2–5 seconds for long periods of up to 3 minutes throughout the day, especially early in the breeding season.Courtship Song.audioA series of complex, warbling, musical phrases of rising and falling elements consisting of 3–12 unique notes, with a large frequency range between 2–9 kHz, and variable duration of 0.3–1.6 seconds per phrase (most phrases around 1 second long), with song bouts lasting for a duration of 1.5–4 minutes. There are no repetitions of the song-phrases, with each phrase unique and showing great variability in quality and construction. During one observation it was given by the presumed male of an apparently mated or courting pair from a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree, while another individual quietly fed close by on the flowers of the same tree. It is only known from two recordings in early May, at different times of day, possibly from the same presumed male. This vocalization, not previously described, differs from the Primary Song in its much greater variety of phrases. It apparently functions as a courtship song, probably given just before nesting commences.Swee or Suweet.audio2 The primary call is a thin, penetrating, up-slurred whistle at around 4–7 kHz, lasting about 0.3 seconds, and repeated every few seconds. It is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics and intruders from territory or suitable foraging areas. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation has been heard from a presumed femaleaudiowhen an intruding Long-tailed Shrike (Lanius schach) was near her nest-site. Both parents would give this call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance.Pip. A short pip contact-call sometimes used by adults to keep in touch with recently fledged juveniles.Geographic VariationNone documented.PhenologyPrimary Song is given from summer onwards and through the breeding season up to at least late July; has also been heard by birds on spring passage in March outside the breeding range in the western Himalayan foothills (8), and one recording also from Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra in the Western Ghats in the same month. There are no known recordings of the Primary Song from outside the breeding season in either autumn or winter and it is probably seldom heard once the young have fledged. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given throughout the year, being the only call typically heard during the nonbreeding season or in its wintering range. The courtship song is given early in the breeding season, probably given just before nesting commences apparently during the pair formation period, probably from late April and upto early May at least, on the breeding grounds.Daily Pattern of VocalizingOnly anecdotal information available. In the breeding season, the Primary Song is given repeatedly and relentlessly throughout the day especially at the beginning of the breeding season when nest-building activities are taking place by the female. The males are aggressively territorial, usually vocalizing throughout the nest-building period, taking short breaks to feed but continuing to vocalize even during foraging; repeatedly give the Primary Song from fixed perches, especially on or near the branch on which the nest was placed. In the nonbreeding season, the birds would give their primary call Swee or Suweet in well-spaced intervals while foraging, more consistently in the early mornings and usually when foraging; but would give this call arbitrarily throughout the day. Begging calls by the juveniles were given constantly through the day, more insistently when the parents were foraging nearby.Places of VocalizingThe Primary Song is given from a variety of perches, including from high in conifer trees, on prominent vantage points, and while foraging low in shrubs or undergrowth near the ground. The few observations of Courtship Song are of birds perched on a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given from a variety of perches, including while foraging low or in upper canopy.

The Primary Song is apparently given only by males, as it was not heard from the nest-building individual (presumed female) during observations from Himachal Pradesh, India (8). The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site; unknown if this variation is a true gender difference or if males can also give this call.Repertoire and Delivery of SongsLittle information available. See Primary Song, above. Based on observations from Himachal Pradesh, as well as from Bangus Meadows, Kashmir, more than two and up to six males can be heard giving the primary song from within a distance of 80–200 meters in suitable habitat, and at times, while foraging together in the same plant or tree (8).Social Context and Presumed Functions of VocalizationsMore study needed. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics from territory or suitable foraging areas. It is also given by presumed males to drive away heterospecifics from territory in the breeding season such as a Yellow-bellied Fairy-Fantail (Chelidorhynx hypoxanthus) that was foraging in the same tree from where the presumed male was delivering its courtship song. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation of the primary call was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site. Both parents would give the primary call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance. The Primary Song appears to primarily function as the territorial song of the species. The courtship song is probably given just before nesting commences, apparently given during the pair formation period.Historical NotesHistorically, there are very few descriptions of the vocalizations of the species and some accounts given of its calls and song are puzzling or difficult to interpret. Most descriptions are generalized and do not afford clarity with one or two exceptions. The first mention of the vocalizations of the species was by Brooks (10: 23) from Kashmir, “In notes and song (if the few notes it utters can be called a song) P. tytleri is utterly different from P. viridanus [= Greenish Warbler Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus]. Its call-note is very peculiar, and once heard could not easily be forgotten.” He also goes on to say, “Properly speaking, none of the notes of P. Tytleri could be called a song, but the song of P. viridanus is not at all a bad one, and quite Phylloscopine.” (11: 80). The Primary Song of the species has been rather aptly paraphrased by Osmaston (12: 990) from observations in Gulmarg, Kashmir as, “the note or song of this species, if it can be called a song, resembles the words ‘Let's kiss him’ repeated at frequent intervals.” Paludan (13) noted the song as ‘’tji-jeep, ‘’tji-jeep’ and ‘vitjip-vitjip’ from its breeding grounds in Nuristan, Afghanistan. Roberts (14) described the song as high pitched, not very loud, and distinctly sibilant rising and falling phrase of about four syllables, the first two short and the last two more emphasized and drawn-out, showing considerable variation but always recognizable of the species. While Jones (15) described the call-note as a thin squeak, it was more accurately described as ‘a plaintive sooeet’ by Price and Jamdar (7); but described as more generalized statements such as, ‘a single squeaky note’ (16) or that the ‘call-note is feeble’ (17). It was also described as a slightly disyllabic call-note which was transcribed as tsee-it (5) and was also likened to Oriental Magpie-Robin (Copsychus saularis)-like ‘sweeee’ in tone, quality and loudness (1).\"}, {'bird_name': 'Short-billed Honeycreeper', 'title': 'Vocalizations', 'text': 'The Short-billed Honeycreeper has a small, indistinct voice.

It shows some variation in quality and length of the first few notes, though the structure of the phrase remains the same, with the final note falling dramatically and having the greatest frequency range. This vocalization appears to serve primarily as the territorial song of the species, and it is often considered to be the Primary Song of the species. It is usually repeated at intervals of 2–5 seconds for long periods of up to 3 minutes throughout the day, especially early in the breeding season.Courtship Song.audioA series of complex, warbling, musical phrases of rising and falling elements consisting of 3–12 unique notes, with a large frequency range between 2–9 kHz, and variable duration of 0.3–1.6 seconds per phrase (most phrases around 1 second long), with song bouts lasting for a duration of 1.5–4 minutes. There are no repetitions of the song-phrases, with each phrase unique and showing great variability in quality and construction. During one observation it was given by the presumed male of an apparently mated or courting pair from a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree, while another individual quietly fed close by on the flowers of the same tree. It is only known from two recordings in early May, at different times of day, possibly from the same presumed male. This vocalization, not previously described, differs from the Primary Song in its much greater variety of phrases. It apparently functions as a courtship song, probably given just before nesting commences.Swee or Suweet.audio2 The primary call is a thin, penetrating, up-slurred whistle at around 4–7 kHz, lasting about 0.3 seconds, and repeated every few seconds. It is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics and intruders from territory or suitable foraging areas. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation has been heard from a presumed femaleaudiowhen an intruding Long-tailed Shrike (Lanius schach) was near her nest-site. Both parents would give this call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance.Pip. A short pip contact-call sometimes used by adults to keep in touch with recently fledged juveniles.Geographic VariationNone documented.PhenologyPrimary Song is given from summer onwards and through the breeding season up to at least late July; has also been heard by birds on spring passage in March outside the breeding range in the western Himalayan foothills (8), and one recording also from Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra in the Western Ghats in the same month. There are no known recordings of the Primary Song from outside the breeding season in either autumn or winter and it is probably seldom heard once the young have fledged. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given throughout the year, being the only call typically heard during the nonbreeding season or in its wintering range. The courtship song is given early in the breeding season, probably given just before nesting commences apparently during the pair formation period, probably from late April and upto early May at least, on the breeding grounds.Daily Pattern of VocalizingOnly anecdotal information available. In the breeding season, the Primary Song is given repeatedly and relentlessly throughout the day especially at the beginning of the breeding season when nest-building activities are taking place by the female. The males are aggressively territorial, usually vocalizing throughout the nest-building period, taking short breaks to feed but continuing to vocalize even during foraging; repeatedly give the Primary Song from fixed perches, especially on or near the branch on which the nest was placed. In the nonbreeding season, the birds would give their primary call Swee or Suweet in well-spaced intervals while foraging, more consistently in the early mornings and usually when foraging; but would give this call arbitrarily throughout the day. Begging calls by the juveniles were given constantly through the day, more insistently when the parents were foraging nearby.Places of VocalizingThe Primary Song is given from a variety of perches, including from high in conifer trees, on prominent vantage points, and while foraging low in shrubs or undergrowth near the ground. The few observations of Courtship Song are of birds perched on a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given from a variety of perches, including while foraging low or in upper canopy.

The Primary Song is apparently given only by males, as it was not heard from the nest-building individual (presumed female) during observations from Himachal Pradesh, India (8). The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site; unknown if this variation is a true gender difference or if males can also give this call.Repertoire and Delivery of SongsLittle information available. See Primary Song, above. Based on observations from Himachal Pradesh, as well as from Bangus Meadows, Kashmir, more than two and up to six males can be heard giving the primary song from within a distance of 80–200 meters in suitable habitat, and at times, while foraging together in the same plant or tree (8).Social Context and Presumed Functions of VocalizationsMore study needed. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics from territory or suitable foraging areas. It is also given by presumed males to drive away heterospecifics from territory in the breeding season such as a Yellow-bellied Fairy-Fantail (Chelidorhynx hypoxanthus) that was foraging in the same tree from where the presumed male was delivering its courtship song. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation of the primary call was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site. Both parents would give the primary call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance. The Primary Song appears to primarily function as the territorial song of the species. The courtship song is probably given just before nesting commences, apparently given during the pair formation period.Historical NotesHistorically, there are very few descriptions of the vocalizations of the species and some accounts given of its calls and song are puzzling or difficult to interpret. Most descriptions are generalized and do not afford clarity with one or two exceptions. The first mention of the vocalizations of the species was by Brooks (10: 23) from Kashmir, “In notes and song (if the few notes it utters can be called a song) P. tytleri is utterly different from P. viridanus [= Greenish Warbler Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus]. Its call-note is very peculiar, and once heard could not easily be forgotten.” He also goes on to say, “Properly speaking, none of the notes of P. Tytleri could be called a song, but the song of P. viridanus is not at all a bad one, and quite Phylloscopine.” (11: 80). The Primary Song of the species has been rather aptly paraphrased by Osmaston (12: 990) from observations in Gulmarg, Kashmir as, “the note or song of this species, if it can be called a song, resembles the words ‘Let's kiss him’ repeated at frequent intervals.” Paludan (13) noted the song as ‘’tji-jeep, ‘’tji-jeep’ and ‘vitjip-vitjip’ from its breeding grounds in Nuristan, Afghanistan. Roberts (14) described the song as high pitched, not very loud, and distinctly sibilant rising and falling phrase of about four syllables, the first two short and the last two more emphasized and drawn-out, showing considerable variation but always recognizable of the species. While Jones (15) described the call-note as a thin squeak, it was more accurately described as ‘a plaintive sooeet’ by Price and Jamdar (7); but described as more generalized statements such as, ‘a single squeaky note’ (16) or that the ‘call-note is feeble’ (17). It was also described as a slightly disyllabic call-note which was transcribed as tsee-it (5) and was also likened to Oriental Magpie-Robin (Copsychus saularis)-like ‘sweeee’ in tone, quality and loudness (1).\"}, {'bird_name': 'Short-billed Honeycreeper', 'title': 'Vocalizations', 'text': 'The Short-billed Honeycreeper has a small, indistinct voice.

Average pitch of such notes diminishes with age from about 4kHz at 10 days to 2‒3kHz at 19 days (20). Begging calls may sound rather gruff. Fledged birds utter a similar begging call. When close to fledging, young also start to utter the Contact call as defined below (20). Contact call of immatures does not differ from adult.Vocal ArrayThe following vocalizations have been described (20), based on a detailed study by Prodon (21):Song.audioA subdued twittering that is somewhat similar to Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica), but simpler, shorter, quieter, lower pitched and uttered less often. Song phrases typically include dry rattles, nasal notes and notes resembling Contact call.Contact call. A short nasal but soft rising note djweet or huet (XC835050). Quite variable, but always rising in pitch. Typically uttered single or doubled, and repeated at irregular intervals. Sometimes in longer series (XC334161). This is the commonest vocalization.Nasal call. A long drawn-out nasal upslurred djweeee (XC381917), resembling rising call of European Greenfinch (Chloris chloris). Sometimes, duration is rather intermediate (XC585423) between this and Contact call.Mewing call. A curious nasal mewing note (XC827676) about 0.4‒0.6 s long, often given a few times at intervals of a few seconds. Somewhat like a short mew of Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo) or a kitten, either overslurred or downslurred.Alarm call.audioA short downslurred whistle tseee (XC931642). Note (polyphonic) has a duration of about 0.15 s and lowest fundamental frequency drops from 4 to 2.5 kHz. Typically repeated several times.Anger call. A short, hard krr.Geographic VariationPreviously was considered conspecific with African Red-rumped Swallow (Cecropis melanocrissus) and Eastern Red-rumped Swallow (Cecropis daurica). There is no published information available regarding possible vocal diversification, but sound recordings at least suggest differences in Contact call. Within the range of present monotypic species, geographic variation is unknown.PhenologyMale starts singing upon arrival on the breeding groups (approximately April), and Song is given throughout the breeding season, until after fledging of the offspring (21). Contact call can be heard throughout the year, while other call types are likely mainly used during the breeding period.Daily Pattern of VocalizingVocalizations can be heard whenever birds are active, without specific preference for the crepuscular hours.Places of VocalizingSong is given when perched or in flight, and has also been heard when male was inside the nest. Contact call is typically given in flight, but also when perched.Sex DifferencesSong is said to be uttered by male. Contact call and Alarm call are uttered by both sexes.Social Context and Presumed Functions of VocalizationsSong is used for mate attraction and territorial advertisement, but is seemingly used less often than in other Hirundinidae. Contact call is given in communication between pair members and between parents and offspring. Also during aggressive pursuits of other swallows near the nest. Nasal calls are sometimes given in alternation with Song by male during pair formation. Possibly an enticement call. Mewing call is only given by male, infrequently throughout the breeding season, apparently in territorial defense. Alarm call is uttered by either sex when an intruder is spotted near the nest, at intervals of less than 1s when danger is imminent. Anger call has been observed by male near nest during an expelling attack on a Barn Swallow.'}]\n",

It shows some variation in quality and length of the first few notes, though the structure of the phrase remains the same, with the final note falling dramatically and having the greatest frequency range. This vocalization appears to serve primarily as the territorial song of the species, and it is often considered to be the Primary Song of the species. It is usually repeated at intervals of 2–5 seconds for long periods of up to 3 minutes throughout the day, especially early in the breeding season.Courtship Song.audioA series of complex, warbling, musical phrases of rising and falling elements consisting of 3–12 unique notes, with a large frequency range between 2–9 kHz, and variable duration of 0.3–1.6 seconds per phrase (most phrases around 1 second long), with song bouts lasting for a duration of 1.5–4 minutes. There are no repetitions of the song-phrases, with each phrase unique and showing great variability in quality and construction. During one observation it was given by the presumed male of an apparently mated or courting pair from a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree, while another individual quietly fed close by on the flowers of the same tree. It is only known from two recordings in early May, at different times of day, possibly from the same presumed male. This vocalization, not previously described, differs from the Primary Song in its much greater variety of phrases. It apparently functions as a courtship song, probably given just before nesting commences.Swee or Suweet.audio2 The primary call is a thin, penetrating, up-slurred whistle at around 4–7 kHz, lasting about 0.3 seconds, and repeated every few seconds. It is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics and intruders from territory or suitable foraging areas. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation has been heard from a presumed femaleaudiowhen an intruding Long-tailed Shrike (Lanius schach) was near her nest-site. Both parents would give this call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance.Pip. A short pip contact-call sometimes used by adults to keep in touch with recently fledged juveniles.Geographic VariationNone documented.PhenologyPrimary Song is given from summer onwards and through the breeding season up to at least late July; has also been heard by birds on spring passage in March outside the breeding range in the western Himalayan foothills (8), and one recording also from Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra in the Western Ghats in the same month. There are no known recordings of the Primary Song from outside the breeding season in either autumn or winter and it is probably seldom heard once the young have fledged. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given throughout the year, being the only call typically heard during the nonbreeding season or in its wintering range. The courtship song is given early in the breeding season, probably given just before nesting commences apparently during the pair formation period, probably from late April and upto early May at least, on the breeding grounds.Daily Pattern of VocalizingOnly anecdotal information available. In the breeding season, the Primary Song is given repeatedly and relentlessly throughout the day especially at the beginning of the breeding season when nest-building activities are taking place by the female. The males are aggressively territorial, usually vocalizing throughout the nest-building period, taking short breaks to feed but continuing to vocalize even during foraging; repeatedly give the Primary Song from fixed perches, especially on or near the branch on which the nest was placed. In the nonbreeding season, the birds would give their primary call Swee or Suweet in well-spaced intervals while foraging, more consistently in the early mornings and usually when foraging; but would give this call arbitrarily throughout the day. Begging calls by the juveniles were given constantly through the day, more insistently when the parents were foraging nearby.Places of VocalizingThe Primary Song is given from a variety of perches, including from high in conifer trees, on prominent vantage points, and while foraging low in shrubs or undergrowth near the ground. The few observations of Courtship Song are of birds perched on a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given from a variety of perches, including while foraging low or in upper canopy.

The Primary Song is apparently given only by males, as it was not heard from the nest-building individual (presumed female) during observations from Himachal Pradesh, India (8). The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site; unknown if this variation is a true gender difference or if males can also give this call.Repertoire and Delivery of SongsLittle information available. See Primary Song, above. Based on observations from Himachal Pradesh, as well as from Bangus Meadows, Kashmir, more than two and up to six males can be heard giving the primary song from within a distance of 80–200 meters in suitable habitat, and at times, while foraging together in the same plant or tree (8).Social Context and Presumed Functions of VocalizationsMore study needed. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics from territory or suitable foraging areas. It is also given by presumed males to drive away heterospecifics from territory in the breeding season such as a Yellow-bellied Fairy-Fantail (Chelidorhynx hypoxanthus) that was foraging in the same tree from where the presumed male was delivering its courtship song. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation of the primary call was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site. Both parents would give the primary call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance. The Primary Song appears to primarily function as the territorial song of the species. The courtship song is probably given just before nesting commences, apparently given during the pair formation period.Historical NotesHistorically, there are very few descriptions of the vocalizations of the species and some accounts given of its calls and song are puzzling or difficult to interpret. Most descriptions are generalized and do not afford clarity with one or two exceptions. The first mention of the vocalizations of the species was by Brooks (10: 23) from Kashmir, “In notes and song (if the few notes it utters can be called a song) P. tytleri is utterly different from P. viridanus [= Greenish Warbler Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus]. Its call-note is very peculiar, and once heard could not easily be forgotten.” He also goes on to say, “Properly speaking, none of the notes of P. Tytleri could be called a song, but the song of P. viridanus is not at all a bad one, and quite Phylloscopine.” (11: 80). The Primary Song of the species has been rather aptly paraphrased by Osmaston (12: 990) from observations in Gulmarg, Kashmir as, “the note or song of this species, if it can be called a song, resembles the words ‘Let's kiss him’ repeated at frequent intervals.” Paludan (13) noted the song as ‘’tji-jeep, ‘’tji-jeep’ and ‘vitjip-vitjip’ from its breeding grounds in Nuristan, Afghanistan. Roberts (14) described the song as high pitched, not very loud, and distinctly sibilant rising and falling phrase of about four syllables, the first two short and the last two more emphasized and drawn-out, showing considerable variation but always recognizable of the species. While Jones (15) described the call-note as a thin squeak, it was more accurately described as ‘a plaintive sooeet’ by Price and Jamdar (7); but described as more generalized statements such as, ‘a single squeaky note’ (16) or that the ‘call-note is feeble’ (17). It was also described as a slightly disyllabic call-note which was transcribed as tsee-it (5) and was also likened to Oriental Magpie-Robin (Copsychus saularis)-like ‘sweeee’ in tone, quality and loudness (1).\"}, {'bird_name': 'Short-billed Honeycreeper', 'title': 'Vocalizations', 'text': 'The Short-billed Honeycreeper has a small, indistinct voice.

It shows some variation in quality and length of the first few notes, though the structure of the phrase remains the same, with the final note falling dramatically and having the greatest frequency range. This vocalization appears to serve primarily as the territorial song of the species, and it is often considered to be the Primary Song of the species. It is usually repeated at intervals of 2–5 seconds for long periods of up to 3 minutes throughout the day, especially early in the breeding season.Courtship Song.audioA series of complex, warbling, musical phrases of rising and falling elements consisting of 3–12 unique notes, with a large frequency range between 2–9 kHz, and variable duration of 0.3–1.6 seconds per phrase (most phrases around 1 second long), with song bouts lasting for a duration of 1.5–4 minutes. There are no repetitions of the song-phrases, with each phrase unique and showing great variability in quality and construction. During one observation it was given by the presumed male of an apparently mated or courting pair from a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree, while another individual quietly fed close by on the flowers of the same tree. It is only known from two recordings in early May, at different times of day, possibly from the same presumed male. This vocalization, not previously described, differs from the Primary Song in its much greater variety of phrases. It apparently functions as a courtship song, probably given just before nesting commences.Swee or Suweet.audio2 The primary call is a thin, penetrating, up-slurred whistle at around 4–7 kHz, lasting about 0.3 seconds, and repeated every few seconds. It is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics and intruders from territory or suitable foraging areas. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation has been heard from a presumed femaleaudiowhen an intruding Long-tailed Shrike (Lanius schach) was near her nest-site. Both parents would give this call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance.Pip. A short pip contact-call sometimes used by adults to keep in touch with recently fledged juveniles.Geographic VariationNone documented.PhenologyPrimary Song is given from summer onwards and through the breeding season up to at least late July; has also been heard by birds on spring passage in March outside the breeding range in the western Himalayan foothills (8), and one recording also from Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra in the Western Ghats in the same month. There are no known recordings of the Primary Song from outside the breeding season in either autumn or winter and it is probably seldom heard once the young have fledged. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given throughout the year, being the only call typically heard during the nonbreeding season or in its wintering range. The courtship song is given early in the breeding season, probably given just before nesting commences apparently during the pair formation period, probably from late April and upto early May at least, on the breeding grounds.Daily Pattern of VocalizingOnly anecdotal information available. In the breeding season, the Primary Song is given repeatedly and relentlessly throughout the day especially at the beginning of the breeding season when nest-building activities are taking place by the female. The males are aggressively territorial, usually vocalizing throughout the nest-building period, taking short breaks to feed but continuing to vocalize even during foraging; repeatedly give the Primary Song from fixed perches, especially on or near the branch on which the nest was placed. In the nonbreeding season, the birds would give their primary call Swee or Suweet in well-spaced intervals while foraging, more consistently in the early mornings and usually when foraging; but would give this call arbitrarily throughout the day. Begging calls by the juveniles were given constantly through the day, more insistently when the parents were foraging nearby.Places of VocalizingThe Primary Song is given from a variety of perches, including from high in conifer trees, on prominent vantage points, and while foraging low in shrubs or undergrowth near the ground. The few observations of Courtship Song are of birds perched on a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given from a variety of perches, including while foraging low or in upper canopy. Begging calls by juveniles were given from low (2–3 meters), inconspicuous perches, usually near the ground, where the juveniles were well obscured.seekmute0:00 / 0:25Primary Song© Puja SharmaKinnaur, Himachal Pradesh, India 29 May 2017Macaulay Library ML 370988931eBirdS67121476Sex DifferencesLittle information. The Primary Song is apparently given only by males, as it was not heard from the nest-building individual (presumed female) during observations from Himachal Pradesh, India (8). The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site; unknown if this variation is a true gender difference or if males can also give this call.Repertoire and Delivery of SongsLittle information available. See Primary Song, above. Based on observations from Himachal Pradesh, as well as from Bangus Meadows, Kashmir, more than two and up to six males can be heard giving the primary song from within a distance of 80–200 meters in suitable habitat, and at times, while foraging together in the same plant or tree (8).Social Context and Presumed Functions of VocalizationsMore study needed. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics from territory or suitable foraging areas. It is also given by presumed males to drive away heterospecifics from territory in the breeding season such as a Yellow-bellied Fairy-Fantail (Chelidorhynx hypoxanthus) that was foraging in the same tree from where the presumed male was delivering its courtship song. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation of the primary call was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site. Both parents would give the primary call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance. The Primary Song appears to primarily function as the territorial song of the species. The courtship song is probably given just before nesting commences, apparently given during the pair formation period.Historical NotesHistorically, there are very few descriptions of the vocalizations of the species and some accounts given of its calls and song are puzzling or difficult to interpret. Most descriptions are generalized and do not afford clarity with one or two exceptions. The first mention of the vocalizations of the species was by Brooks (10: 23) from Kashmir, “In notes and song (if the few notes it utters can be called a song) P. tytleri is utterly different from P. viridanus [= Greenish Warbler Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus]. Its call-note is very peculiar, and once heard could not easily be forgotten.” He also goes on to say, “Properly speaking, none of the notes of P. Tytleri could be called a song, but the song of P. viridanus is not at all a bad one, and quite Phylloscopine.” (11: 80). The Primary Song of the species has been rather aptly paraphrased by Osmaston (12: 990) from observations in Gulmarg, Kashmir as, “the note or song of this species, if it can be called a song, resembles the words ‘Let's kiss him’ repeated at frequent intervals.” Paludan (13) noted the song as ‘’tji-jeep, ‘’tji-jeep’ and ‘vitjip-vitjip’ from its breeding grounds in Nuristan, Afghanistan. Roberts (14) described the song as high pitched, not very loud, and distinctly sibilant rising and falling phrase of about four syllables, the first two short and the last two more emphasized and drawn-out, showing considerable variation but always recognizable of the species. While Jones (15) described the call-note as a thin squeak, it was more accurately described as ‘a plaintive sooeet’ by Price and Jamdar (7); but described as more generalized statements such as, ‘a single squeaky note’ (16) or that the ‘call-note is feeble’ (17). It was also described as a slightly disyllabic call-note which was transcribed as tsee-it (5) and was also likened to Oriental Magpie-Robin (Copsychus saularis)-like ‘sweeee’ in tone, quality and loudness (1).\"}, {'bird_name': 'Short-billed Honeycreeper', 'title': 'Vocalizations', 'text': 'The Short-billed Honeycreeper has a small, indistinct voice.

Female Kwik-kwik-kwik call is often given in response to male Advertisement call, as an asynchronous duet.'}, {'bird_name': \"Tytler's Leaf Warbler\", 'title': 'Vocalizations', 'text': \"DevelopmentLittle information available. The vocal repertoire and behaviors of adults during nesting and rearing of young, as well as information on the vocal development and behaviors of begging juveniles and presumed social contexts have been described from Himachal Pradesh, India by Sharma (8); the following description of the begging calls has been adapted from it.Begging calls.audio2 A clear thin, piercing, high-pitched squeak at around 6–10 kHz lasting about 0.3 seconds; reminiscent of treecreepers (Certhiidae) and unlike the Swee whistle of the adults. Can be given constantly through the day, more insistently when the parents were foraging nearby, at the rate of one note per second for long durations of up to 2 minutes, until the begging juvenile was fed. The rate of calling can accelerate to as fast as two notes per second for 4–6 seconds when the parent approaches to feed the juveniles. Though often given from low (2–3 meters), inconspicuous perches where the juveniles are well obscured, their loud, penetrating calls can give their positions away.Tsip. During short, weak flights the juveniles can give a short series of Tsip notesaudioat a constant 6–7 kHz, typically when following their parents to the ground or while changing perches.Vocal ArrayThe Primary Song of Tytler’s Leaf Warbler is well described from its breeding grounds in Kashmir, India and northern Pakistan (3, 9), but several components of the vocalizations that were previously unknown, especially from the breeding season, have been described from its breeding grounds in India by Sharma (8); the repertoire description below draws on this as well as previous descriptions.seekmute0:00 / 0:22Primary Songgiven from variety of perches; also, while foraging.© Puja SharmaKinnaur, Himachal Pradesh, India 29 May 2017Macaulay Library ML 370988911eBirdS67121476Primary Song.audio2 An extremely brief, explosive, chirpy cluster of 4–6 unique notes, with a large frequency range of 2–10 kHz, lasting from 0.45–0.75 seconds, which can be rendered as Shitsu-shuwitsu or Chitsi-chitsu. It shows some variation in quality and length of the first few notes, though the structure of the phrase remains the same, with the final note falling dramatically and having the greatest frequency range. This vocalization appears to serve primarily as the territorial song of the species, and it is often considered to be the Primary Song of the species. It is usually repeated at intervals of 2–5 seconds for long periods of up to 3 minutes throughout the day, especially early in the breeding season.Courtship Song.audioA series of complex, warbling, musical phrases of rising and falling elements consisting of 3–12 unique notes, with a large frequency range between 2–9 kHz, and variable duration of 0.3–1.6 seconds per phrase (most phrases around 1 second long), with song bouts lasting for a duration of 1.5–4 minutes. There are no repetitions of the song-phrases, with each phrase unique and showing great variability in quality and construction. During one observation it was given by the presumed male of an apparently mated or courting pair from a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree, while another individual quietly fed close by on the flowers of the same tree. It is only known from two recordings in early May, at different times of day, possibly from the same presumed male. This vocalization, not previously described, differs from the Primary Song in its much greater variety of phrases. It apparently functions as a courtship song, probably given just before nesting commences.Swee or Suweet.audio2 The primary call is a thin, penetrating, up-slurred whistle at around 4–7 kHz, lasting about 0.3 seconds, and repeated every few seconds. It is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics and intruders from territory or suitable foraging areas. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation has been heard from a presumed femaleaudiowhen an intruding Long-tailed Shrike (Lanius schach) was near her nest-site. Both parents would give this call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance.Pip. A short pip contact-call sometimes used by adults to keep in touch with recently fledged juveniles.Geographic VariationNone documented.PhenologyPrimary Song is given from summer onwards and through the breeding season up to at least late July; has also been heard by birds on spring passage in March outside the breeding range in the western Himalayan foothills (8), and one recording also from Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra in the Western Ghats in the same month. There are no known recordings of the Primary Song from outside the breeding season in either autumn or winter and it is probably seldom heard once the young have fledged. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given throughout the year, being the only call typically heard during the nonbreeding season or in its wintering range. The courtship song is given early in the breeding season, probably given just before nesting commences apparently during the pair formation period, probably from late April and upto early May at least, on the breeding grounds.Daily Pattern of VocalizingOnly anecdotal information available. In the breeding season, the Primary Song is given repeatedly and relentlessly throughout the day especially at the beginning of the breeding season when nest-building activities are taking place by the female. The males are aggressively territorial, usually vocalizing throughout the nest-building period, taking short breaks to feed but continuing to vocalize even during foraging; repeatedly give the Primary Song from fixed perches, especially on or near the branch on which the nest was placed. In the nonbreeding season, the birds would give their primary call Swee or Suweet in well-spaced intervals while foraging, more consistently in the early mornings and usually when foraging; but would give this call arbitrarily throughout the day. Begging calls by the juveniles were given constantly through the day, more insistently when the parents were foraging nearby.Places of VocalizingThe Primary Song is given from a variety of perches, including from high in conifer trees, on prominent vantage points, and while foraging low in shrubs or undergrowth near the ground. The few observations of Courtship Song are of birds perched on a low (2 meters) branch of a rhododendron tree. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given from a variety of perches, including while foraging low or in upper canopy. Begging calls by juveniles were given from low (2–3 meters), inconspicuous perches, usually near the ground, where the juveniles were well obscured.seekmute0:00 / 0:25Primary Song© Puja SharmaKinnaur, Himachal Pradesh, India 29 May 2017Macaulay Library ML 370988931eBirdS67121476Sex DifferencesLittle information. The Primary Song is apparently given only by males, as it was not heard from the nest-building individual (presumed female) during observations from Himachal Pradesh, India (8). The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site; unknown if this variation is a true gender difference or if males can also give this call.Repertoire and Delivery of SongsLittle information available. See Primary Song, above. Based on observations from Himachal Pradesh, as well as from Bangus Meadows, Kashmir, more than two and up to six males can be heard giving the primary song from within a distance of 80–200 meters in suitable habitat, and at times, while foraging together in the same plant or tree (8).Social Context and Presumed Functions of VocalizationsMore study needed. The primary call Swee or Suweet is given by both sexes in a variety of contexts, primarily as an alarm or warning, but it may also function as a contact-call, and is used by males to drive away conspecifics from territory or suitable foraging areas. It is also given by presumed males to drive away heterospecifics from territory in the breeding season such as a Yellow-bellied Fairy-Fantail (Chelidorhynx hypoxanthus) that was foraging in the same tree from where the presumed male was delivering its courtship song. A slightly shorter and lower-pitched variation of the primary call was given by a female when an intruding Long-tailed Shrike was near her nest-site. Both parents would give the primary call while feeding begging juveniles, upon sensing human presence, or as a result of a disturbance. The Primary Song appears to primarily function as the territorial song of the species. The courtship song is probably given just before nesting commences, apparently given during the pair formation period.Historical NotesHistorically, there are very few descriptions of the vocalizations of the species and some accounts given of its calls and song are puzzling or difficult to interpret. Most descriptions are generalized and do not afford clarity with one or two exceptions. The first mention of the vocalizations of the species was by Brooks (10: 23) from Kashmir, “In notes and song (if the few notes it utters can be called a song) P. tytleri is utterly different from P. viridanus [= Greenish Warbler Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus]. Its call-note is very peculiar, and once heard could not easily be forgotten.” He also goes on to say, “Properly speaking, none of the notes of P. Tytleri could be called a song, but the song of P. viridanus is not at all a bad one, and quite Phylloscopine.” (11: 80). The Primary Song of the species has been rather aptly paraphrased by Osmaston (12: 990) from observations in Gulmarg, Kashmir as, “the note or song of this species, if it can be called a song, resembles the words ‘Let's kiss him’ repeated at frequent intervals.” Paludan (13) noted the song as ‘’tji-jeep, ‘’tji-jeep’ and ‘vitjip-vitjip’ from its breeding grounds in Nuristan, Afghanistan. Roberts (14) described the song as high pitched, not very loud, and distinctly sibilant rising and falling phrase of about four syllables, the first two short and the last two more emphasized and drawn-out, showing considerable variation but always recognizable of the species. While Jones (15) described the call-note as a thin squeak, it was more accurately described as ‘a plaintive sooeet’ by Price and Jamdar (7); but described as more generalized statements such as, ‘a single squeaky note’ (16) or that the ‘call-note is feeble’ (17). It was also described as a slightly disyllabic call-note which was transcribed as tsee-it (5) and was also likened to Oriental Magpie-Robin (Copsychus saularis)-like ‘sweeee’ in tone, quality and loudness (1).\"}, {'bird_name': 'Short-billed Honeycreeper', 'title': 'Vocalizations', 'text': 'The Short-billed Honeycreeper has a small, indistinct voice. The call is a short and high pitched tsee with a rapid inflection toward a high pitch (Schulenburg et al. 2007). These call notes can be given in sets. There are no songs recorded for this species and no song has been identified (Hilty 2011). Additional audio recordings of calls of the Short-billed Honeycreeper can be heard at Macaulay Library and at xeno-canto.'}, {'bird_name': 'Mourning Collared-Dove', 'title': 'Vocalizations', 'text': \"Vocal DevelopmentNo information.Vocal ArrayAdvertisement call.audio2 A long series of coos with a distinct rhythmic pattern: a series is initiated with a short overslurred coo followed by a rolling trill, thereafter by repeated (⁓6‒14) disyllabic hoots,: whUh..rurrrrrr....hu-hoo..hu-hoo..hu-hoo..hu-hoo.... Initial notes may be repeated twice, and the latter may also be a trisyllabic hu-hoo-oo. Duration of such series is highly dependent on number of coos (typically 8‒20s), and intervals between series have a similar duration.Coo-purr.audioNear identical to the first part of the advertisement call, a short overslurred coo followed by a rolling trill, delivered in long series whUh-rurrrrrr....whUh-rurrrrrr...whUh-rurrrrrr...Rattle.audioA rising and falling, mournful rattle rrraooooh. Duration ⁓1‒1.5s, number of notes in the Rattle ranges from 10 (in West-Africa) to 30.A slightly different context-based categorization distinguishes (as in most pigeon species) the 'Perch-coo' (considered to be the hu-hoo part in the advertisement call), the 'Bow-coo' (the Coo-purr) and the 'Nest coo' (the Coo-purr) (3). For the genus Streptopelia the common ancestor apparently had differentiated coos for these three types, but in several species 2 or 3 evolved into acoustically similar vocalisations (4). For the Mourning Collared-Dove, 'Bow-coo' and 'Nest coo' are (near) identical.Geographic VariationHas not been analysed in detail. Based on available recordings, stereotypical Advertisement call is very similar over its entire range, while Rattle call in West Africa (race shelleyi) is more nasal and pace of rattle is markedly slower than elsewhere.PhenologyAdvertisement call is heard year-round, but most often during peak breeding season.Daily Pattern of VocalizingAdvertisement call is heard most often in morning and evening, but also throughout the day.Places of VocalizingAdvertisement call is typically given from a horizontal tree branch at mid-height. Coo-purr is uttered during the bowing display on the ground, and also near its nest in a tree. Rattle call is often given in flight or when landing.Sex DifferencesNo information.Repertoire and Delivery of SongsAdvertisement call may have disyllabic or trisyllabic coos (independent of geographical location), it is not clear if this is an individual feature or variants of a bird's repertoire.Social Context and Presumed Functions of VocalizationsVocal behaviour has been less studied than in several of its congeners. Advertisement call, the long-distance vocalisation, is used for territorial defence and mate attraction. Coo-purr is used during the bowing display and also around the nest site.\"}]\n",
